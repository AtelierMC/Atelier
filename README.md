## JettPack

AtelierSMP is a fork of [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) with some performance patches from many sources.

### Here's some of the most notable additions my fork contains:
1. Reduced allocations, reducing memory usage and therefore the frequency at which garbage collection runs from [JettPack](https://gitlab.com/Titaniumtown/JettPack).
2. Faster random implementation from [JettPack](https://gitlab.com/Titaniumtown/JettPack).
3. Reduction in unnecessary packets (thanks to [Slice](https://github.com/Cryptite/Slice)).
4. Hopper optimization (thanks to [EMC](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft)).
